        <h3>Hi! My Name is Kayla Chavez</h3>

        <h3>About Kayla</h3>
        <p>I am currently a graphic designer based in Carlsbad. I took some coding classes in my last year of college and was fascinated by it but never had the opportunity to pursue it as I was already set to graduate. Quarantine gave me the opportunity to reevaluate and I realized I truly wanted to pursue a career in software engineering!</p>
        <!--my hobbies and interest-->
        <p>When I am not working or learning how to code, I am also a huge bookworm so you may find me reading or at a bookstore finding another book to add to my never ending booklist. I also love to travel and I am constantly thinking of new adventures to go on! My goal is to visit Tokyo, Japan!</p>
        <!--will link To Thinkful Website-->
        <p>I am extremely grateful to be a student at <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com/" target = "_blank">Thinkful</a> and very excited about my journey as a software engineer! If you want to reach out and work together or maybe just talk about all things coding.... I would love that! You can connect with me through LinkedIn or Github! </p>
