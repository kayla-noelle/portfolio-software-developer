        <h2>About Kayla</h2>
        <p>I am currently a graphic designer based in Carlsbad. I took some coding classes in my last year of college and was fascinated by it but never had the opportunity to pursue it as I was already set to graduate. Quarantine gave me the opportunity to reevaluate and I realized I truly wanted to pursue a career in software engineering!</p>
        <!--my hobbies and interest-->
        <p>When I am not working or learning how to code, you can find me reading or exploring the wonderful stores in downtown Carlsbad!</p>
        <!--will link To Thinkful Website-->
        <p>I am extremely grateful to be a student at <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com/" target = "_blank">Thinkful</a> and very excited about my journey as a software engineer! </p>
